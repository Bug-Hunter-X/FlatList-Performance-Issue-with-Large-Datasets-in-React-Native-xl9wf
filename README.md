# React Native FlatList Performance Issue with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native with large datasets. The provided code fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API and renders it using FlatList.  When dealing with significant data volumes, the application may experience slow rendering, unresponsiveness, or even crashes.

The solution showcases efficient data handling techniques to mitigate this problem.  This includes implementing pagination and virtualization techniques for improved performance and memory management.

## Problem

The initial `DataFetch.js` component fetches data from an API endpoint and directly renders it using FlatList. This approach becomes inefficient and resource-intensive when dealing with large datasets.  The app might struggle to render everything at once, impacting performance and potentially leading to crashes.

## Solution

The `DataFetchSolution.js` component implements the following optimization strategies:

* **Pagination:** Fetching and rendering data in smaller chunks rather than all at once.  This reduces initial load time and memory usage. 
* **Virtualization:** Rendering only the items visible on the screen at any given time and recycling components as the user scrolls.  This significantly reduces memory consumption and performance overhead.

These improvements make the FlatList component more efficient and reliable when handling substantial amounts of data.
